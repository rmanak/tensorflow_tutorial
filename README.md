# TensorFlow Tutorials/Examples

These tutorials are all for **TensorFlow 1.8**. (See what is new in TF 1.9: [TensorFlow 1.9.0 Release](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.9.0))

- Tutorial 1: Basic variables, placeholders, matrix operations and session in TF

- Tutorial 2: Batch gradient decent linear regression in TensorFlow

- Tutorial 3: Logical/Control operations

- Tutorial 4: Logistic regression using TensorFlow

- Tutorial 5: Fully connected neural net "from scratch" (using TF's matrix operations) for binary classification

- Tutorual 6: MNIST image classification using multilayer fully connected NN built using `tf.layers` API and data processing using `tf.data` API

## Extras

These are mainly some confusing concepts in TF/Keras that I tried to clarify by code snippets.

- XTutorial 1: Demonstrates that `TimeDistributed(Dense(n))` layer in Keras is identical to applying `Dense(n)` layer.
